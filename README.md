ToastBuddyLib
=============

Easily show messages to the player via little toast popups in XNA/MonoGame

For an example of how to use this library, check out the sample project:

https://github.com/dmanning23/ToastBuddyLib

This library has been tested on Windows and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
